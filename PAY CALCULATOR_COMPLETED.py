# PAY CALCULATOR 

# Pay Calcualtor provides how much you will earn in a paycheck and has a mini calculator mode to help wage calcualtions and bills
# NOTE: Due to this program not being tailored to your companies payroll calculations, allow for some pay discrepency.->
#-> However you will get a decent idea of how much you will be earning in your coming paycheck.

##### ENTER THESE AMOUNTS #####
hourly_pay = 0  # Enter in your hourly pay rate

bonus_pay = 0   # Enter your bonus/incentive/overtime rate or any other type of additional rate adds on top of your hourly-pay   
total_deduction = 0    # Take the percentage of Tax that is deducted and turn it into decimal format. 
# NOTE: Due to differences in state-income tax, a difinitive percentage cannot be provided. ->
# Calculate the percentage of tax that was reduced from your last 3 paychecks ->
# and enter the percentage that is most consistantly deducted.

sum_of_differentials = 0  # Enter the sum total of differentials added. 
# NOTE: because differentials in companies are calculated based on different methods -> 
# Pay Calculator only adds the sum of the differentials (YOU calculate and provide) to your base pay. ->
